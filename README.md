## Soar with Deno ðŸš€ðŸ¦•
Welcome to the Soar with Deno quest! This project introduces Deno, a modern JavaScript runtime, empowering developers to build efficient, scalable, and secure backend applications. Leveraging the Oak middleware framework and Deno's native TypeScript support, you'll gain hands-on experience in creating robust backend systems.


## ðŸŒŸ Overview
Deno is an innovative runtime designed to address the challenges faced with traditional JavaScript runtimes like Node.js. It offers a secure execution model, built-in utilities, and native TypeScript support. This guide will walk you through core Deno concepts and tools, helping you transition from Node.js or enhance your JavaScript skills.

# Why Deno?
Secure Execution Model: Permissions-based system ensures unauthorized access prevention.
Native TypeScript Support: Write and execute TypeScript out of the box.
Modern Development Tools: Built-in utilities for formatting, linting, testing, and dependency management.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes
By the end of this quest, you will:

Build backend applications using Deno and the Oak framework.
Perform CRUD operations with SQLite databases using @db/sqlite.
Secure applications with the WebCrypto API for JWT authentication (@zaubrik/djwt).
Hash passwords securely using @denosaurs/argontwo.
Master Denoâ€™s dependency management with Import Maps.
